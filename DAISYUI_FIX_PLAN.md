# DaisyUI v5 Configuration Fix Plan

## Issue Identified
The current configuration uses a mixed approach that's not fully compatible with Tailwind CSS v4. Based on the DaisyUI documentation, there's a specific way to configure DaisyUI with Tailwind CSS v4.

## Root Cause
1. The current `src/app.css` file uses the old Tailwind v3 approach with a comment about DaisyUI being loaded through PostCSS
2. The `tailwind.config.js` file still includes the DaisyUI plugin configuration, which is not the recommended approach for Tailwind v4
3. The `postcss.config.js` file has both Tailwind and DaisyUI plugins, but the CSS file isn't properly configured

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update src/app.css
Replace the current content with the proper Tailwind v4 and DaisyUI v5 configuration:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "daisyui";
```

### 2. Update tailwind.config.js
Simplify the configuration to remove the DaisyUI plugin since it's now being loaded directly in the CSS file:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  // Remove the plugins section since DaisyUI is now loaded via CSS
}
```

### 3. Update postcss.config.js
Keep only the Tailwind PostCSS plugin since DaisyUI is now loaded via CSS:
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};
```

### 4. Rebuild and Test
Run the build command to generate the new CSS with proper DaisyUI styles:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Expected Outcome
After these changes, the DaisyUI components should render with their proper styling, matching the official DaisyUI component examples.
